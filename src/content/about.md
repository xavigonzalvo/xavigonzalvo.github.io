I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Enginyeria i Arquitectura La Salle, Universitat Ramon Llull (URL) in Barcelona, Spain, in 2004. In 2010, I completed my Ph.D. studies at the same institution.

Between 2003 and March 2008, I worked as an Assistant Researcher at the Department of Communications and Signal Theory, Enginyeria i Arquitectura LaSalle. Following that, I joined Phonetic Arts Ltd in Cambridge, UK, which was a video game company dedicated to producing high-quality synthetic speech.

After spending three exhilarating years as a researcher at Phonetic Arts Ltd, we were acquired and moved to Google in London. At Google, I was appointed as a technical lead manager of the research team. After five years, I transitioned to the Research and Machine Intelligence team in Google NY.

I'm now leading the AutoLX team to improve core ML algorithms in areas like AutoML, ML efficiency, ensembles, multi-source adaptation, model architectures, multiple loss functions, and transformers.
