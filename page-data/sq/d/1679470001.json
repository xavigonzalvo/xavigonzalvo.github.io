I'm now focused on LLMs for efficiency and learning without training. My research explores in-context learning dynamics, how prompts can be transmuted into model weights, and the equivalence between context and parameter updates in transformers, aiming to improve long context handling and optimize memory and tokens usage at the model level.</p>\n<p>This website is a personal platform, and any views expressed here are solely mine and do not represent the opinions of Google.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/xavigonzalvo.github.io/xavigonzalvo.github.io/src/content/about.md"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Electrical engineer, ML researcher"},"html":"<p>I'm Xavier, an electrical engineer based in New York city.
